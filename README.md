## 🧩 Modular JSON Logic

Each plate type is defined in a separate JSON block for easy customization:
- `plateType`: Defines background, font, and layout  
- `regionCode`: Supports bilingual formatting (e.g. "MU" for Muscat)  
- `fontStyle`: Uses Bold Naskh for Arabic digits  

To modify or add new plate types, edit the `licenseplates_oman.json` file inside the mod folder.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If plates don’t appear:
- Make sure the mod is enabled in **Mod Manager**  
- Restart BeamNG.drive after installation  
- Check for mod conflicts with other license plate mods
